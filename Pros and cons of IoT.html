     <h1>Pros and cons of IoT</h1>
    <p>
        The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the internetworking of computing devices, machines, objects and more, that are embedded with unique identifiers and have the ability to transfer data over a network. The vast amount of intelligence and services brought to the table, have the potential to significantly shape our everyday lives â€“ how we manage our cities, healthcare and even how we grow our food. To date, there are over 20 billion things connected to the internet, with that number expected to jump to 50 billion by 2020. Surprisingly, many people use IoT every day without even knowing it. Connected thermostats, ATM machines, wearables and even traffic lights all make up the IoT. Below we discuss the pros and cons of the IoT and how it could change your everyday life, very soon.
